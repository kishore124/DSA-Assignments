/*
 * <aside> ðŸ’¡ **Q2.** Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all
 * occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be
 * changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to
 * val.
 * 
 * Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to
 * get accepted, you need to do the following things:
 * 
 * - Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
 * elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not
 * important as well as the size of nums. - Return k.
 ** 
 * Example :** Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3 Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_*,_*]
 ** 
 * Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements
 * of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k
 * (hence they are underscores)[
 * 
 * </aside>/ */
